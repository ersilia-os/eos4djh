Title: Basic molecular descriptors from Datamol
Description: Basic molecular descriptors calculated with the Datamol package, including
  molecular weight, lipophilicity (cLogP), hydrogen bond donnors, hydrogen bond acceptors,
  etc. These descriptors are generally useful to annotate small molecule libraries.
  They are not recommended for QSAR modeling since they are probably too simple for
  most scenarios.
Mode: Pretrained
Task: Representation
Input: Compound
Input Shape: Single
Output: Descriptor
Output Type: Float
Output Shape: List
Interpretation: Basic molecular descriptors. Some descriptors are floats and some
  are counts.
