Title: Basic molecular descriptors from Datamol
Description: Basic molecular descriptors calculated with the Datamol package, 
  including molecular weight, lipophilicity (cLogP), hydrogen bond donnors, 
  hydrogen bond acceptors, etc. These descriptors are generally useful to 
  annotate small molecule libraries. They are not recommended for QSAR modeling 
  since they are probably too simple for most scenarios.
